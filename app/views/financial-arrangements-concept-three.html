          <p>
            If you can't agree how your assets will be split you can ask the court to make a <span class="bold-small">financial order</span>.  This can be used to decide how your money and property are divided and to order your wife to pay you maintenance.
            A financial order is the only way to make the split legally binding. You can apply for orders for yourself, and your children if you have any.

          <p>
            The only way to make your agreement legally binding is to get a type of <span class="bold-small">financial order</span> called a <span class="bold-small">consent order</span>. If you're already in the process of getting one of these then select <span class="bold-small">Yes</span>. <!-- You don't need to do anything else to apply for one now, but you will be better protected in future if you select 'Yes'. -->
          </p>

          <p>If you have no assets, the only way to is to get a <span class="bold-small">clean break order</span>.</p>
