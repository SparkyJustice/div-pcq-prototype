For example, if you inherit money or win the lottery you could be ordered to give some of it to them despite being divorced many years.

  Even if you don't want to make any financial claim now, you may want to ask the court to make a <span class="bold-small">financial order</span> which ends any financial ties between you after you are divorced. This is known as a <span class="bold-small">clean break order</span> and can be used to prevent any financial claims against each other which you may have now or in the future.
