<p>
  The court will make its decision on whether you should pay any costs when you submit your application for decree nisi. <!-- It will take all your circumstances into account, including your conduct, and your husband/wife's conduct, before and during the divorce. -->
</p>
<p>
  You'll be given the court's decision at the same time as you find out if the divorce will be granted, and the date of the hearing that the decree nisi will be made.
</p>


<!-- <p class="text">
      It's up to the court to decide how the costs will be split, but it will usually split the costs as follows (unless you accept half the costs, or your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} provides a good enough reason to not pay anything).
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading-small">2 years separation with consent</h3>

    <p class="text">
     The court will usually make an order that the respondent pay half of the applicant's costs.
   </p>

   <h3 class="heading-small">5 years separation</h3>

   <p class="text">
    The court usually won't make a costs order. However, it could order the respondent to pay costs under some circumstances.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">Behaviour, adultery, and desertion</h3>
  <p class="text">
    The court will usually order the respondent to pay all of the applicant's costs, unless the applicant has asked for less. If the court decides that the respondent should also pay the applicant's legal costs, it will usually order that the respondent only pay what it judges to be a reasonable amount of these. However, under certain circumstances it could order you to pay more.
  </p> -->
    <p>
      If the court rules in your favour, your  {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }} <!-- [, and the co-respondent if applicable] --> will be ordered to pay you back your costs within 14 days of the order being made.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }} can dispute the costs order. They'll need to tell the court why they don't think they should pay at least 14 days before the hearing.
