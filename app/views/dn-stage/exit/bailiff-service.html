Using a court bailiff to serve (deliver) the application to your {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }}

<p class="text">
	If you think that your {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }} is deliberately not responding to the divorce application you can pay for a court bailiff to deliver it to them.</p>

<p class="text">
	If the bailiff succeeds in delivering the application to your {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }}, you'll be given a 'certificate of service' which you can then send to the court. This will mean that you can continue with your divorce without your {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }}'s response. 
</p>
<p class="text">
	If the bailiff can't deliver the application (eg because they can't find them) you'll need to either:</p>

	<ul class="list list-bullet text">
 		<li>use another method of delivering the application</li>
 		<li>apply to the court to dispense with (not need) a response</li>
 	</ul>
