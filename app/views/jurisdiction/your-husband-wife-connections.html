      <p class="bold-small">Habitual residence</p>
     <p class="text">
        Your habitual residence is the place in which your life is mainly based. You must be settled there and intend to stay settled there. For example, you work there, own property, have your children in school there, and your main family life takes place there.
      </p>

      <p class="bold-small">Domicile</p>
      <p class="text">
        Your domicile is the main permanent home in which you live, or to which you intend to return. When you were born you will have acquired your parents' domicile (either your father's if they were married, or your mother's if they werenâ€™t married or if your father died before you were born). If you have since moved to another country and made that your permanent home then your domicile may have moved there.
