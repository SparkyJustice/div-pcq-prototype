  <span class="bold-small">Habitual Residence</span> means that you live voluntarily and for settled purposes (such as
  work, training, family life) in England or Wales, apart from temporary or occasional absences. You must spend a
  substantial amount of time in a place to be habitually resident there. This does not have to be your permanent home.
