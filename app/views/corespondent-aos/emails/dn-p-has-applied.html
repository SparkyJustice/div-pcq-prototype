Reference no: 4829-1351-1234-2343
</p>
<p>
Dear {{ respsName() }},
</p>

<p>Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} has applied for a decree nisi. The court will check your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}'s application for a decree nisi and pass it to the judge. </p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">
	What happens next
</h2>

<p>
	If the judge agrees there's no reason why you shouldnt get a divorce, you'll be sent the time, date and court in which your decree nisi will be announced.
</p>

<p>
	After the decree nisi has been announced, your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} will have to wait 6 weeks before they can apply for a ‘decree absolute’ to end the marriage. If they haven't applied for a decree absolute 3 months after that 6 week period has passed, you'll be able to apply for it yourself. You'll be told how to apply at the time.
</p>
