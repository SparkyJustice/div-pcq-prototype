    <p>
      The court will make a decision on this at the same time as it considers whether the divorce should be granted. You'll be sent an email when the decision has been made, and the date of the hearing at which the cost order will be made.

    <h3 class="heading-small">Objecting to a costs order</h3>

    As you haven't given your consent, the divorce won't be able to continue based on the 2 years separation with consent 'fact' (reason for divorce). 
</p>


<p class="text">
    The application will be returned to your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}. If they choose to continue, they will need to change the reason for divorce to one that doesn't need your consent.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} will have to pay £95 to change the reason. You may have to pay some or all of this extra fee if they've applied to claim their divorce costs.
</p>

<p>
    You'll be contacted by the court when your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} has made their decision.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">If you decide that you want to consent to the divorce</h2>
<p>
    You can change your mind and give your consent to the divorce at any time. You'll need to do this in writing. Contact the divorce centre if you want to do this.
</p>
{% elif session.respondent.aos.admitAdultery == "No" %}
<p>
    The court needs to be sure that adultery took place for it to be used as the reason for divorce (legally known as the 'fact').
</p>


<p>
    To continue with the divorce your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} will need to either:
</p>

<ul class="bullet list-bullet">
    <Li>change their reason for divorce (and pay a fee of £95)</li>
        <li>provide evidence of the adultery</li>

    </p>

    <h3 class="heading-small">Objecting to the costs order</h3>

    <p>
      If the court grants a costs order, you can dispute it if you don't think that you should pay it. You'll need to send a letter to the court stating why you don't think you should pay at least 14 days before the hearing.

    <p class="text">
      It's advisable to have a legally-binding arrangement with your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} on your finances, even if you don't have many assets (for example, money, belongings, or property) and you currently have a good relationship with them.
     </p>

      <p class="text">
        Together, you can apply for a consent order, in which you both agree how your money and property will be split. 
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        To get a consent order, you should pay a solicitor to draft one for you, and then send it to the court with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/money-property-when-relationship-ends/apply-for-consent-order" target="blank">consent order forms</a> and a £50 fee.
      </p>
