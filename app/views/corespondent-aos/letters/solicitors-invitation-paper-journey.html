Dear Benjamin Smyth,
</p>

<p>
	You've been named as the legal representative of {{ respsName() }} in {{ respsSpouseName() }}'s application for divorce. Please find a copy of the application included with this letter.
</p>

<p>
	You need to respond within 7 days. If you donâ€™t respond, the applicant can ask the court to move the divorce forwards without a response. Your client may have to pay extra fees if this happens.
</p>

<p>
	Please contact us if you can't respond for any reason, or if the 7 days have passed.
</p>

<p class="bold-small">
	How to respond
</p>

<ol class="list list-number">
    <li>1. Read the application for divorce.</li>
	<li>2. Complete the 'Respond to a divorce application' form included with this letter.</li>
	<li>3. Return the form to the divorce centre within 7 days.</li>
</ol>

<p class="bold-small">
	You must only respond if you are Benjamin Smyth or someone they have appointed to respond for them. You could be fined or imprisoned for contempt of court if you respond falsely.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-small">Polygamous marriages</h2>

<p>
	You must tell us if your client has been married to more than one person during this marriage.
