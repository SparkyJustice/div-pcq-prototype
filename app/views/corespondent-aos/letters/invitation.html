Dear Sidney Masterton,
</p>

<!-- <p>
	You have been named as a co-respondent in the divorce between {{ petsSpouseName() }} (the applicant) and {{ respsSpouseName() }} (the respondent). A co-respondent is someone who the applicant has alleged to have committed adultery with the respondent. You can find a copy of the application included with this letter. 
</p> -->

<p>
	You have been named in {{ petsSpouseName() }}'s application for divorce from {{ respsSpouseName() }}.
</p>

	<p> This means that {{ petsSpouseName() }} (the applicant) has used adultery as the reason for their divorce, and alleged that {{ respsSpouseName() }} (the respondent) committed that adultery with you (the co-respondent).
</p>

<p>
	<span class="bold-small">You need to respond within 7 days.</span> As you have been named as a co-respondent in the divorce, the applicant is allowed to claim the costs of the divorce from you. This could include the £550 application fee, and their legal fees and expenses. If you don't respond, you won't have a say in whether or not you pay these costs.
</p>

<p>
	Please contact us if you can't use the online service for any reason, or if the 7 days have passed.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-small">Getting help</h2>

<p>
	The online service is written in plain English and designed to be used by citizens. You can find further guidance on divorce at www.gov.uk/divorce.
</p>

	<p class="bold-small">
		You must only respond if you are Sidney Masterton or someone they have asked to represent them. You could be fined or imprisoned for contempt of court if you respond falsely.
	</p>

	<h2 class="heading-small">Solicitors</h2>
	<p>
		If you want to use a solicitor, you must give them this letter as soon as possible.

	</p>
	If you're a solicitor, we're still working on the solicitor's online service. For now, you'll need to respond using the paper forms. Please contact us to have these sent to you.
