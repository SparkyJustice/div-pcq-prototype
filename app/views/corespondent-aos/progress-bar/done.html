<h2 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h2>

<p class"text">
        Your response will be sent to the applicant. They can then apply for the court order which will divorce them and the respondent.
    </p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">If the applicant has claimed their costs</h2>

    <p>
        The court will make a decision on this at the same time as it considers whether the divorce should be granted. You'll be sent an email when the decision has been made, and the date of the hearing at which the costs order will be made. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading-small">Objecting to a costs order</h3>

    <p>
      You can object to a costs order if you don't think that you should pay it. You'll need to email the court at least 14 days before the hearing, giving your reasons.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    You can contact the Courts and Tribunals Service Centre if you don't hear anything back after 6 weeks.
