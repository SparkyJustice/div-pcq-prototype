<h4 class="heading-medium">Your answer has been received by the court</h4>

<p class="text">
	Your ‘answer’ to the divorce application has been received by the court.
</p>
 
<p class="text">
	A Judge will now decide whether you and your wife will need to attend a hearing. You may be contacted for more information to help them make that decision. 
 </p>

<p class="text">
	You’ll receive a letter in the post telling you if you need to attend a hearing, and when and where that hearing is.
</p>

<p class="text">
	If after the hearing the court decides that the divorce can go ahead, then the rest of the divorce will be online.
