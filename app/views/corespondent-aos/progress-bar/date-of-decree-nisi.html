<h4 class="heading-medium">The application for a decree nisi has been accepted</h4>

<p class="text">
  A district judge will formally announce the decree nisi at a court hearing. This is the first stage of the decree ending the marriage.
</p>

<p class="text">
  The court has also decided to make an order that you pay towards the divorce costs.
</p>

       <p class="text">
        The divorce is only complete when the decree absolute has been granted.

<h2 class="heading-medium">The hearing</h2>


  <p>
    You can find more details about the date of the hearing and the orders that will be made (including costs orders) in the <a href="/public/pdf/certificate-of-entitlement.pdf" target="_blank">Entitlement to a decree</a> (PDF, 69kb).
</p>

<div class="notice">
  <i class="icon icon-important">
    <span class="visually-hidden">Warning</span>

  <strong class="bold-small">
    You don’t need to come to the hearing unless you want to object to the costs order.
  </strong>
</div>

<br>

<p> If you want to attend the hearing, you need to email the court before the hearing date. If you want to dispute a costs order, the court must receive a letter or email stating the reasons for doing so at least 14 days before the hearing date.

<h2 class="heading-medium">
  Stages of the decree
</h2>

<p>
  The order (known as a decree) is made in 2 stages. You’re only divorced once both stages are complete.
</p>


<ol class="list list-number">
  <li>The 'decree nisi', which shows that the court agrees that you’re entitled to a divorce.</li>
  <li>The ‘decree absolute’, which legally ends the marriage. It cannot be made until at least 6 weeks after the decree nisi.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The court can cancel (known as rescind) the decree nisi at any time up until the decree absolute, if it's presented with new evidence showing why you shouldn’t be given a divorce.
