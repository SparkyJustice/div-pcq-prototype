<p class="text">
  Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} has based the breakdown of the marriage on the fact that you have been separated for 2 years, and that you give your consent (agreement) to a divorce.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The court must have your consent for the divorce to continue on these grounds.

  <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">

  <p class="text">
  If you don't agree, then the divorce won't be able to continue based on 2 years separation with consent.
</p>


<p class="text">
  The application will be returned to your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}. If they choose to continue, they will need to change the reason for divorce to one that doesn't need your consent. 
</p>

<p class="text">
  Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} will have to pay Â£95 to change the reason. You may have to pay some or all of this extra fee if they've applied to claim their divorce costs.
