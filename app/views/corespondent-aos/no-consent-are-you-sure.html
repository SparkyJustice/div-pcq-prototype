  <p class="text">
  If you don't agree, then the divorce won't be able to continue based on 2 years separation with consent.
</p>


<p class="text">
  The application will be returned to your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}. If they choose to continue, they will need to change the reason for divorce to one that doesn't need your consent. 
</p>

<p class="text">
  Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} will have to pay Â£95 to change the reason. You may have to pay some or all of this extra fee if they've applied to claim their divorce costs.
