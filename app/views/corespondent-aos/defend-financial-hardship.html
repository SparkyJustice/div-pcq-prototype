Are you defending the divorce as it would cause you severe hardship?

  <p class="text">
    As your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} used 5 years separation as the reason for divorce, you can defend it on the basis that it will cause you severe hardship.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    The hardship could be financial (for example, you'll lose your rights to a widow's pension) or another type of hardship (for example, you'll be stigmatized for cultural or religious reasons).

  <p>
    You'll need to convince the court that the hardship will be severe.
  </p>

  <p>
    The court will take your and your husband's individual circumstances and interests into acccount. It will also take into account the needs of any children if you have any, and anyone else who would be affected by a divorce.
  </p>

  <p>
    Severe hardship is rarely used as a defence against divorce, and it's even rarer for the court to reject a divorce application because of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll need to make your case for hardship in another form (called the 'answer'). The deadline for this is within 21 days of when you first signed in to respond to the application. You'll also have to pay another Â£245 fee.
