<h2 class="heading-medium">You can now finalise your divorce</h2>

<p>
  You can now apply for the decree absolute which will end your marriage.
</p>

<p> 
  This is because 3 months have passed since your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} was able to apply for a decree absolute. As they haven't applied yet, you can now apply for it yourself.
</p>

<p> You'll both have to go to a court hearing if you're the one applying for the decree absolute, and not your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}.
</p>

<p>
  You can apply at any time, but if you wait until after 7 August 2018 (1 year after the decree nisi) you’ll need to explain the delay to the court.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">How to apply</h2>

<p class="text">
   <p class="text">Download and complete <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=98" target="_blank">form D11</a> and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/688018/d36-eng.pdf" target="_blank">form D36</a> and send both forms to the Courts and Tribunals Service Centre.
 </p>

<p class="text">
  You and your husband/wife will need to attend a hearing where a judge will make a decision on the divorce. Your husband/wife will need to explain why they haven’t applied for the decree absolute.
</p>

<p class="text">
  The court will contact you with the date and address of the hearing.

    <p>
      The court order for divorce (known as a decree) is made in 2 stages. You’re only divorced once both stages are complete.
    </p>


    <ol class="list list-number">
      <li>The 'decree nisi', which shows that the court agrees that you’re entitled to a divorce.</li>
      <li>The ‘decree absolute’, which legally ends the marriage. The applicant can apply for it 6 weeks after the decree nisi has been granted. The respondent can apply for it after a further 3 months have passed.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The court can cancel (legally known as rescind) the decree nisi at any time up until the decree absolute, if it's presented with new evidence showing why you shouldn’t be given a divorce.
