                The court has accepted your application for 'deemed service'. This means it accepts that your {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }} received the application, and you don't need their response to proceed.
              <p> 
            <p>
              This means that you can now continue with your divorce as if they had responded.

            <!-- <h4 class="heading-medium">Your husband has responded to your divorce application</h4>
            <p>The court has posted you a copy of your husband’s response to your divorce application (known as the ‘acknowledgement of service’).</p>

            <p>You need to read his response and check that the signature on the response is his.</p>

            <p>Don’t continue until you have received and checked his response.</p>
