      <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do now</h2>


      <h3 class="heading-small">1. Write your reference number on each document</h3>


      <p class="text">Write your reference number on the back of each of the following:</p>

    <ul class="list list-bullet">
     <li>your original marriage certificate or a certified copy</li>
     <li>proof of your name change, for example a deed poll. Include proof of each change if you've done it more than once since you got married</li>
     <li>an English translation of your marriage certificate</li>
   </ul>


      <h3 class="heading-small">2. Post your documents</h3>

    </ol>

    <p class="text">
      You must send your original marriage certificate or a certified copy. Don't send a photocopy. Your certificate will be kept by the court and won't be returned to you.
    </p>


    <p class"text">
     Post all your documents to:
   </p>

   <ul class="list bold-small">
     <li>East Midlands Regional Divorce Centre</li>
     <li>PO Box 10447</li>

   <h2 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h2>
   


   <p class="text">
    Your application will be checked. If it's correct, you'll be sent a notice saying that your application has been issued (sent out). You'll also get a case number and a copy of the application stamped by the divorce centre.
  </p>

<p class="text">
  Your {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }} will also receive a copy of the application and a form to return. If you have used adultery as your reason for divorce, and named the person that your {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }} committed adultery with, they will also get a copy and a form to return.
