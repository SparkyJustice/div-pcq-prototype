      The applicant's costs usually include the £550 fee. They could also include other court fees and costs. The costs could be much higher if your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} has legal fees (eg a solicitor) and these are also included in the order.

   <p class="text">
The applicant's costs usually include the £550 fee. They could also include other court fees and costs. The costs could be much higher if your husband has legal fees (eg a solicitor) and these are also included.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-small">What happens now</h3>


   <p class="text">
Your husband will be asked to confirm that they want to claim their costs when they apply for a decree nisi.
</p>
   <p class="text">
The court will then make its decision on whether you should pay any costs. It will take all your circumstances into account, including your conduct, and your husband's conduct, before and during the divorce.
</p>
   <p class="text">
You'll be given the court's decision at the same time as you find out if the divorce will be granted, and the date of the hearing that the decree nisi will be made.

    <h3 class="heading-small">
Objecting to the costs order
</h3>

   <p class="text">
You can dispute the costs order if you don't think that you should pay it. You'll need to send a letter to the court stating why you don't think you should pay at least 14 days before the hearing.

<!-- 

    <p class="text">
      It's up to the court to decide how the costs will be split, but it will usually split the costs as follows unless you provide a good enough reason to not pay anything.
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading-small">2 years separation with consent</h3>

    <p class="text">
     The court will usually make an order that the respondent pay half of the applicant's costs.
   </p>

   <h3 class="heading-small">5 years separation</h3>

   <p class="text">
    The court usually won't make a costs order. However, it could order the respondent to pay costs under some circumstances.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">Behaviour, adultery, and desertion</h3>
  <p class="text">
    The court will usually order the respondent to pay all of the applicant's costs. If the court decides that the respondent should also pay the applicant's legal costs, it will usually order that the respondent only pay what it judges to be a reasonable amount of these. However, under certain circumstances it could order you to pay more and the costs could be significantly higher.

      How the court usually splits the costs:

    <ul class="list-bullet list">
      <li> In divorces based on 2 years separation, the court will usually make an order that the respondent pay half of the applicant's costs.

        In divorces based on 5 years separation, the court usually won't make a costs order. However, it could order the respondent to pay costs under some circumstances.

      <li>
        In divorces based on behaviour, adultery, or desertion the court will usually order the respondent to pay all of the applicant's costs, unless the applicant has asked for less. If the court decides that the respondent should also pay the applicant's legal costs, it will usually order the respondent only pay what it judges to be a reasonable amount of these.
