<p>
Dear {{ respsName() }},
</p>

<p>
	Your decree nisi (court order) for a divorce from John James Dante was made on 8 August 2017. The order was announced by District Judge Wylie at East Midlands Regional Divorce Centre.
</p>

<p>
	The judge also made a court order giving your {{respsHusbandOrWife () }} the right to claim their divorce costs from you.
</p>


<div class="panel panel-border-wide">
  <p>
  	You are not divorced yet. You will only be divorced when the second stage is complete and you have your decree absolute.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
	You can download certificates for both these orders from your account.</p>

</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">When the divorce can be completed</h2>

<p>
	Your {{respsHusbandOrWife () }} can apply for the decree absolute from 20 September 2017. This is because, by law, they must wait for 6 weeks after the decree nisi is granted.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">What to do with the costs order</h2>

<p>
  The order will state what the court has decided you must pay your {{ respsHusbandOrWife()}}. You are required to pay them within 14 days of the order being made. If you don't pay within that time, your {{ respsHusbandOrWife()}} can use the order to make a money claim against you.
