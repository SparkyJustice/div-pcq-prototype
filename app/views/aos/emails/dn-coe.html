Reference no: 4829-1351-1234-2343
</p>
<p>
	Dear {{ respsName() }},
</p>

<p class="text">
	Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}'s application for a decree nisi has been accepted. The court certifies that you are entitled to a decree of divorce.  The court will also make an order that you pay some or all of the divorce costs.

</p>

<p class="text">
	A district judge will formally announce this at a hearing on 21 April 2019. You will not be divorced at that stage. You are only divorced when you have your decree absolute, which legally ends the marriage. Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} can apply for that 6 weeks after the decree nisi is announced.
</p>
</p>

<p class="text">
	You donâ€™t need to come to the hearing unless you want to object to any of the orders being made. Contact the court by 7 April 2019 if you want to attend.
</p>
