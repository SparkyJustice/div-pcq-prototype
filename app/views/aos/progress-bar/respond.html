<p class="text">
  You need to read your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}'s application before you give your response. You can find a copy in the letter that was sent to you, and a digital version with guidance on what each section means on the next screen.
</p>

<div class="panel panel-border-wide">
<p class="text">
  Your response is legally known  as the 'acknowledgement of service'.
</p>
</div>


<p class="text">
  You must respond to the application within 7 days. If you donâ€™t, your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} can ask the court to move the divorce forwards without you. You may have to pay extra fees if this happens.
