            To defend the divorce you need to submit the '<a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2651" target="_blank">answer to a divorce application</a>' form. The deadline for this is 21 days from the date that you first signed in to respond to the application.
        </p>

        <p class"text">
        Download and fill in the paper form.

            As you haven't given your consent, the divorce won't be able to continue based on the 2 years separation with consent 'fact' (reason for divorce).

            <p class="text">
            The application will be returned to your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}. If they choose to continue, they will need to change the reason for divorce to one that doesn't need your consent.

            <p class="text">
            Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} will have to pay £95 to change the reason. You may have to pay some or all of this extra fee if they've applied to claim their divorce costs.

            <p>
            You'll be contacted by the court when your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} has made their decision.

            Your response will be checked and then sent to your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}. They can then apply for the court order which will divorce you.
            </p>

            <p>
            The order (known as a decree) is made in 2 stages. You’re only divorced once both stages are complete.
            </p>


            <ol class="list list-number">
            <li>The 'decree nisi', which shows that the court agrees that you’re entitled to a divorce.</li>
            <li>The ‘decree absolute’, which legally ends the marriage. It cannot be made until at least 6 weeks after the decree nisi.
            </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            You'll be sent an email after each stage.
            </p>

            <p>
            The court can cancel (legally known as rescind) the decree nisi at any time up until the decree absolute, if it's presented with new evidence showing why you shouldn’t be given a divorce.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
            Contact the divorce centre if you don't hear anything back after 6 weeks.

    <!-- <h2 class="heading-medium">Dividing your money and property</h2>

    <p class="text">
      It's advisable to have a legally-binding arrangement with your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} on your finances, even if you don't have many assets (for example, money, belongings, or property) and you currently have a good relationship with them.
     </p>

      <p class="text">
        Together, you can apply for a consent order, in which you both agree how your money and property will be split. 
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        To get a consent order, you should pay a solicitor to draft one for you, and then send it to the court with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/money-property-when-relationship-ends/apply-for-consent-order" target="blank">consent order forms</a> and a £50 fee.
