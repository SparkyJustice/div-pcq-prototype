Do you intend to ask the court to delay the divorce until itâ€™s satisfied with your financial situation?

<p>
  As your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} used separation as the reason for divorce, you can ask the court to consider what your financial position will be afterwards.</p>
  <p>
    The court may then decide to delay the final stage of the divorce (the decree absolute) until it is satisfied with the future financial arrangements between you and your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }}.

      <p>
        If you ask the court to do this, it won't make the decree absolute unless it's satisfied that your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} either:
      </p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>has made or will make financial provision for you that is reasonable and fair or the best that can they can do under the circumstances</li>
        <li>shouldn't have to provide for you financially</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When making its decision the court will take into account both of your individual circumstances (for example your ages, health, conduct, and earning capacities) and your financial position should your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} die first.
      </p>

         <p>
          The court may decide not to delay the divorce if there are circumstances under which it shouldn't be delayed and the court is satisfied that your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} will make appropriate financial provision for you.
