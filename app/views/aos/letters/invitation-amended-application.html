<p class="text">
	Dear {{ respsName() }},
</p>

<p>
	Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} {{ respsSpouseName() }} has changed their application for divorce.</p>

	<p>
		<span class="bold-small">You need to respond to this new application within 7 days.</span> If you don’t, your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} can ask the court to move the divorce forwards without you. You may have to pay extra fees if this happens. 
	</p>


	<p class="bold-small">
		How to respond
	</p>

	<ol class="list list-number">
		<li>1. Sign into your account at <a href="/aos/start-page" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">www.gov.uk/divorce-respond</a>. </li>
		<li>2. Enter your new reference number: <span class="bold-small">1234 - 5678 - 9012 - 4567</span></li>
		<li>3. Enter your new access code: <span class="bold-small">847395</span></li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Please contact us if you can't use the online service for any reason, or if the 7 days have passed.
	</p>


	<h2 class="heading-small">Getting help</h2>

	<p>
		The online service is written in plain English and designed to be used by citizens. You can find futher guidance at:
	</p>

	<ul class="list list-bullet">
		<li>www.gov.uk/divorce</li>
		<li>Citizens Advice (www.citizensadvice.org.uk/family/ending-a-relationship/)</li>
		<li>Advicenow (www.advicenow.org.uk/divorce)</li>
		<li>Personal Support Unit for support in court hearings (www.thepsu.org)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	If you disagree with your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} about these arrangements it is usually cheaper and quicker to resolve this through mediation, rather than through the courts. You can find more information about mediation at www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk.
</p>

<p>
	You must tell us if you’ve been married to more than one person during this marriage (polygamy).
</p>

	<p class="bold-small">
		You must only sign in if you are the respondent or their representative. You could be fined or imprisoned for contempt of court if you access it illegally.
	</p>

	<h2 class="heading-small">Solicitors</h2>
	<p>
		If you want to use a solicitor, you must give them this letter as soon as possible.

	</p>
	If you're a solicitor, we're still working on the solicitor's online service. For now, you'll need to respond using the paper forms. Please contact us to have these sent to you.
