<p class="text">
	Dear {{ respsName() }},
</p>

<p>
	Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} {{ respsSpouseName() }} has applied for a divorce.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="bold-small">You need to respond within 7 days.</span> If you don’t respond, your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} can ask the court to move the divorce forwards without you. You may have to pay extra fees if this happens. 
</p>

<p class="bold-small">
	How to respond
</p>

<ol class="list list-number">
	<li>1. Read the application for divorce.</li>
	<li>2. Complete the 'Respond to a divorce application' form included with this letter.</li>
	<li>3. Return the form to the Courts and Tribunals Service Centre within 7 days.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Please contact us if you can't respond for any reason, or if the 7 days have passed.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-small">Getting help</h2>

<p>
	For further guidance on divorce, how to split money and property, and make child arrangements visit:

<ul class="list list-bullet">

		<li>Citizens Advice (www.citizensadvice.org.uk/family/ending-a-relationship/)</li>

		<li>Personal Support Unit for support in court hearings (www.thepsu.org)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	If you disagree with your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} about these arrangements it is usually cheaper and quicker to resolve this through mediation, rather than through the courts. You can find more information about mediation at www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk.
</p>

<p>
	You must tell us if you’ve been married to more than one person during this marriage (polygamy).
</p>

<p class="bold-small">
	You must only respond if you are {{ respsName() }} or someone they have asked to represent them. You could be fined or imprisoned for contempt of court if you respond falsely.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-small">Solicitors</h2>
	<p>
		If you want to use a solicitor, you must give them this letter as soon as possible.

	</p>
	If you're a solicitor, we're still working on the solicitor's online service. For now, you'll need to respond using the paper forms. Please contact us to have these sent to you.
	</p>


<!-- <h2 class="heading-small">How legal rights and responsibilities change after divorce</h2>

<p>After you're divorced:</p>

<ol class="list list-number">
    <li>- any right you may have to a pension which depends on the marriage continuing will be affected</li>
	<li>- you will not be able to claim a State widow's pension when the applicant dies</li>
	<li>- any matrimonial home rights you may have (under Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996) will cease unless the Court has ordered otherwise before the divorce is granted</li>
	<li>- you will lose your right to inherit from the applicant if they die without having made a will</li>
	<li>- if the applicant has made a will, you won't have any right which you may have under that will to act as executor, trustee or as a donee of a power of appointment or to take any gift under the will, unless a contrary intention appears in the will</li>
	<li>- if the applicant has appointed you to become guardian of the applicant's  children on their death, a divorce will deprive you of any right which you may have to act as a guardian (unless the applicant specifies otherwise)</li>
</ol>

<p>
	A divorce may have other consequences in your case depending on your particular circumstances. If you are in any doubt about these you should speak to a legal adviser (for example a solicitor).
