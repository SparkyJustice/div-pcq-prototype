Dear {{ petsName() }},
</p>

<p>
	A legal adviser has found that your divorce can't continue based on the information you've provided so far.
</p> 

<p>
	You need to change part of your application or provide more information.
</p>

<p>
	You'll also need to pay a £95 amendment fee, as the application will need to be reissued and sent back to your {{ petsHusbandOrWife() }}.
</p>

<!-- <p>
	Your divorce can only continue once you've done this.
</p> -->
