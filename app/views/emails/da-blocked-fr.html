Dear {{ petsName() }},

<p class="text">
	It's been 6 weeks since your decree nisi was granted and usually this would mean that you could finalise your divorce by gettting a decree absolute.
</p>

<p class="text">
		However, our records show that there is an outstanding application for a financial order. You can't finalise your divorce until the court has made a decision on this.
